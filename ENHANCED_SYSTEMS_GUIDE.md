# üöÄ Enhanced Alliance Selector & Honor Roll System Guide

## Overview

The Alliance Selector and Honor Roll (School System) have been significantly enhanced with the same advanced logic used in the team stats system. These improvements provide more accurate team evaluation, strategic alliance optimization, and comprehensive performance analysis.

## ü§ù Enhanced Alliance Selector

### Key Improvements

#### 1. **Enhanced Team Scoring Algorithm**
- **Multi-factor Evaluation**: Teams are now scored using:
  - Enhanced EPA calculation with proper phase weighting
  - Robot valuation integration for quality assessment
  - Consistency scoring (0-100 scale based on standard deviation)
  - Clutch factor (ability to perform under pressure)
  - Strategic role identification (defense, auto specialist, etc.)

#### 2. **Advanced Scoring Weights**
```python
W_AUTO = 1.5      # Increased weight for autonomous performance 
W_TELEOP = 1.0    # Base teleop weight
W_ENDGAME = 1.2   # Increased weight for endgame (critical for close matches)
W_DEFENSE = 12    # Defense bonus for strategic value
W_CONSISTENCY = 5 # New weight for consistency bonus
W_CLUTCH = 8      # New weight for high-pressure performance
```

#### 3. **Strategic Alliance Analysis**
- **Alliance Composition Display**: Shows combined EPA, strategy notes, and team roles
- **Real-time Strategy Insights**: 
  - `DEF`: Defensive specialist
  - `ELITE`: High robot valuation (>85)
  - `AUTO`: Strong autonomous performer
  - `CONSISTENT`: High consistency score (>80)
  - `CLUTCH`: Strong clutch performance (>75)

#### 4. **Auto-Optimization Features**
- **Smart Alliance Building**: Considers team synergy and strategic balance
- **Complementary Strategy Matching**: Pairs defensive captains with offensive picks
- **Performance Synergy**: Combines teams with complementary strengths
- **Strategy Balance Analysis**: Ensures diverse alliance approaches across event

### New Interface Features

#### Enhanced Alliance Table
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Alliance # | Alliance number (1-8) |
| Captain | Alliance captain (auto-assigned by rank) |
| Pick 1 | First pick selection |
| Recommendation 1 | AI-suggested first pick |
| Pick 2 | Second pick selection |
| Recommendation 2 | AI-suggested second pick |

#### Optimization Controls
- **Auto-Optimize All**: Automatically optimizes all alliance selections
- **Balance Strategies**: Analyzes and balances strategic approaches
- **Reset Picks**: Clears all selections to start fresh

### Strategic Analysis Features

#### Team Synergy Calculation
The system now evaluates team compatibility using:
- **Defensive Synergy**: Defensive captain + offensive picks
- **Autonomous Synergy**: Multiple strong auto performers
- **Endgame Synergy**: Teams with strong endgame capabilities
- **Consistency Bonus**: Reliable performers get priority
- **Elite Robot Bonus**: High robot valuation teams

#### Strategy Balance Recommendations
- **Ideal Distribution**: 30% defensive, 50% offensive, 20% balanced
- **Real-time Analysis**: Shows current strategy distribution
- **Strategic Warnings**: Alerts for imbalanced alliance composition

- **Robot Valuation Scaling**: Pit scores scaled by robot quality
- **Performance-Based Inference**: Competencies inferred from actual performance data
- **Consistency-Based Organization**: Team organization scores based on performance consistency

#### 2. **Intelligent Competency Detection**
```python
# Enhanced competency inference
if died_rate < 0.15:  # Very low death rate
    - "no_deaths": True
    - "reliability": True

if teleop_score > 70:
    - "driving_skills": True

if auto_score > 60:
    - "pasar_inspeccion_primera": True

if overall_avg > 75:
    - "win_most_games": True

if robot_valuation > 80:
    - "commitment": True
```

#### 3. **Enhanced Scoring Methodology**

##### Match Performance Scores (50% of total)
- **Autonomous**: Scaled with 1.2x multiplier for importance
- **Teleop**: Base scoring with 1.0x multiplier
- **Endgame**: Scaled with 1.1x multiplier for critical moments

##### Pit Scouting Scores (30% of total)
- **Performance-Factor Scaling**: Scores adjusted by robot valuation
- **Quality-Based Adjustments**: Elite robots get enhanced pit scores
- **Realistic Scaling**: Scores range from 70-130% of base values

##### During Event Scores (20% of total)
- **Consistency-Based Organization**: Higher consistency = better organization
- **Performance-Linked Collaboration**: Strong teams show better collaboration

#### 4. **Enhanced Final Scoring**
- **Curved Grading System**: Top performer anchors at 100%
- **Competency Bonuses**: 
  - Main competencies: 6 points each
  - Subcompetencies: 3 points each
- **Behavior Reports**: Penalty system (currently disabled)

### New Interface Features

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Team Class (Alliance Selector)
```python
class Team:
    def __init__(self, num, rank, total_epa, auto_epa, teleop_epa, endgame_epa, 
                 defense=False, name=None, robot_valuation=0, 
                 consistency_score=0, clutch_factor=0):
        # Enhanced attributes for comprehensive evaluation
        self.robot_valuation = float(robot_valuation)
        self.consistency_score = float(consistency_score)
        self.clutch_factor = float(clutch_factor)
```

### Enhanced Scoring Algorithm
```python
def compute_score(self):
    base_score = (W_AUTO * self.auto_epa + W_TELEOP * self.teleop_epa + 
                  W_ENDGAME * self.endgame_epa)
    defense_bonus = W_DEFENSE if self.defense else 0
    consistency_bonus = (self.consistency_score / 100) * W_CONSISTENCY
    clutch_bonus = (self.clutch_factor / 100) * W_CLUTCH
    valuation_multiplier = 1.0 + (self.robot_valuation / 1000)
    
    return (base_score + defense_bonus + consistency_bonus + clutch_bonus) * valuation_multiplier
```

### Enhanced Auto-Population (Honor Roll)
```python
# Performance-based scaling
auto_scaled = min(100, max(0, phase_scores["autonomous"] * 1.2))
teleop_scaled = min(100, max(0, phase_scores["teleop"] * 1.0))
endgame_scaled = min(100, max(0, phase_scores["endgame"] * 1.1))

# Robot valuation-based pit scoring
performance_factor = min(1.3, max(0.7, robot_valuation / 70))
electrical_score = base_electrical * performance_factor
```
